# Security Improvements for Serverless Converter

## Implemented Security Enhancements

### 1. Authentication and Authorization
- Added JWT-based API Gateway authorizer to secure all endpoints
- Implemented token validation and IAM policy generation
- Added environment variable for JWT secret with recommendation to use AWS Secrets Manager in production

### 2. Input Validation and Sanitization
- Enhanced file validation in PDF to Word conversion:
  - Added file size limits (10MB max)
  - Implemented PDF header validation
  - Added additional MIME type checks
- Sanitized file paths to prevent command injection attacks
- Added timeout for conversion processes to prevent resource exhaustion

### 3. IAM Permissions
- Applied least privilege principle to IAM roles
- Added specific permissions for CloudWatch Logs
- Restricted S3 bucket permissions to only necessary actions

### 4. CORS Configuration
- Restricted CORS to specific origins instead of wildcard (*)
- Limited allowed headers to only those necessary
- Maintained existing CORS methods and max age settings

### 5. API Rate Limiting
- Added throttling to all API endpoints
- Set different rate limits for different endpoint types:
  - 5 requests per second for conversion endpoints
  - 10 requests per second for status and download endpoints
- Added burst limits to handle traffic spikes

### 6. Environment Variables
- Created `.env.example` template without hardcoded credentials
- Added notes about proper credential management

## Additional Recommended Security Measures

### 1. Persistent Job Storage
Replace in-memory job storage with DynamoDB:
```yaml
resources:
  Resources:
    JobsTable:
      Type: AWS::DynamoDB::Table
      Properties:
        TableName: ${self:service}-${self:provider.stage}-jobs
        BillingMode: PAY_PER_REQUEST
        AttributeDefinitions:
          - AttributeName: jobId
            AttributeType: S
        KeySchema:
          - AttributeName: jobId
            KeyType: HASH
        TimeToLiveSpecification:
          AttributeName: expiresAt
          Enabled: true
```

### 2. File Scanning for Malware
Implement a file scanning solution using ClamAV or a commercial service:
```javascript
// Example integration with ClamAV
async function scanFile(filePath) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const clamav = spawn('clamdscan', ['--no-summary', filePath]);
    clamav.on('close', (code) => {
      resolve(code === 0); // 0 means no virus found
    });
    clamav.on('error', reject);
  });
}

// Use in conversion functions
const isSafe = await scanFile(file.path);
if (!isSafe) {
  await cleanupFiles(file.path);
  return {
    statusCode: 400,
    body: JSON.stringify({ error: 'Security scan failed. File may contain malware.' })
  };
}
```

### 3. Secure File Storage
Encrypt sensitive files at rest:
```javascript
// Update S3 bucket configuration
Resources:
  UploadBucket:
    Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
    Properties:
      BucketName: ${self:custom.bucketName}
      BucketEncryption:
        ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration:
          - ServerSideEncryptionByDefault:
              SSEAlgorithm: AES256
```

### 4. Enhanced Logging and Monitoring
Implement structured logging and CloudWatch alarms:
```javascript
// Structured logging example
function logEvent(level, message, data) {
  console.log(JSON.stringify({
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    level,
    message,
    ...data,
    // Never log sensitive information
    ...(data.sensitive ? { sensitive: '[REDACTED]' } : {})
  }));
}

// Usage
logEvent('info', 'Processing file', { jobId, fileType, fileSize });
```

### 5. Web Application Firewall (WAF)
Implement AWS WAF to protect against common web exploits:
```yaml
resources:
  Resources:
    ApiGatewayWaf:
      Type: AWS::WAFv2::WebACL
      Properties:
        Name: ${self:service}-${self:provider.stage}-waf
        Scope: REGIONAL
        DefaultAction:
          Allow: {}
        VisibilityConfig:
          SampledRequestsEnabled: true
          CloudWatchMetricsEnabled: true
          MetricName: ${self:service}-${self:provider.stage}-waf-metric
        Rules:
          - Name: AWSManagedRulesCommonRuleSet
            Priority: 0
            OverrideAction:
              None: {}
            VisibilityConfig:
              SampledRequestsEnabled: true
              CloudWatchMetricsEnabled: true
              MetricName: AWSManagedRulesCommonRuleSet
            Statement:
              ManagedRuleGroupStatement:
                VendorName: AWS
                Name: AWSManagedRulesCommonRuleSet
```

## Security Best Practices Checklist

- [ ] Use AWS Secrets Manager for storing JWT secrets and other credentials
- [ ] Enable AWS CloudTrail for auditing API calls
- [ ] Implement regular security scanning of dependencies
- [ ] Set up automated vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Create a security incident response plan
- [ ] Implement proper error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information
- [ ] Regularly rotate access keys and credentials
- [ ] Use temporary credentials with STS when possible
- [ ] Implement multi-factor authentication for AWS console access
- [ ] Regularly review and update IAM policies

## Conclusion

The security improvements implemented in this update address several critical vulnerabilities in the Serverless Converter application. By following the additional recommendations and best practices outlined in this document, you can further enhance the security posture of your application.

Remember that security is an ongoing process, not a one-time implementation. Regularly review and update your security measures as new threats emerge and as your application evolves.
