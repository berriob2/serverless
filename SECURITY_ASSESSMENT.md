# Security Assessment Report for Serverless Converter

## Overview

This security assessment identifies potential vulnerabilities in the Serverless Converter application and provides recommendations to address them.

## Critical Issues

### 1. Hardcoded AWS Credentials in .env File

**Vulnerability**: AWS credentials are hardcoded in the `.env` file.

**Risk**: If the repository is accidentally made public or compromised, attackers could gain access to AWS resources.

**Recommendation**: 
- Remove hardcoded credentials from the `.env` file
- Use AWS IAM roles for Lambda functions
- For local development, use AWS profiles or environment variables that aren't committed to the repository
- Add `.env` to `.gitignore` if not already present

### 2. Overly Permissive CORS Configuration

**Vulnerability**: The S3 bucket CORS configuration allows requests from any origin (`'*'`).

**Risk**: This could enable cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.

**Recommendation**: 
- Restrict CORS to specific origins where the application is hosted
- Replace `'*'` with an array of allowed domains

### 3. Command Injection Risk in Python Process Spawning

**Vulnerability**: The `spawn('python3', ['pdf_to_word.py', localInputPath, outputPath])` call in `convertPdfToWord.js` could be vulnerable if input paths contain malicious characters.

**Risk**: Potential command injection if file paths aren't properly sanitized.

**Recommendation**: 
- Validate and sanitize file paths before passing to spawn
- Consider using absolute paths to the Python script
- Implement input validation to reject file paths with suspicious characters

## High Severity Issues

### 4. Insufficient Input Validation

**Vulnerability**: While there is some file type validation, it may not be comprehensive enough to prevent all malicious file uploads.

**Risk**: Attackers could upload malicious files that bypass validation.

**Recommendation**: 
- Implement more robust file validation beyond just checking extensions and MIME types
- Consider using a file scanning service for malware detection
- Implement file size limits to prevent denial of service attacks

### 5. In-Memory Job Storage

**Vulnerability**: Job information is stored in-memory using a Map object in `progress.js`.

**Risk**: 
- Job information is lost when Lambda containers are recycled
- Potential memory leaks if many jobs accumulate
- No persistence across multiple Lambda instances

**Recommendation**: 
- Use a persistent storage service like DynamoDB for job tracking
- Implement TTL (Time To Live) for job records
- Add pagination for job listing to prevent excessive memory usage

### 6. Missing Authentication and Authorization

**Vulnerability**: API endpoints lack authentication mechanisms.

**Risk**: Anyone can use the conversion services without authorization, potentially leading to abuse.

**Recommendation**: 
- Implement API Gateway authorizers (e.g., JWT, Lambda authorizer)
- Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Consider implementing user accounts for tracking usage

## Medium Severity Issues

### 7. Insufficient Error Handling

**Vulnerability**: Some error messages may expose sensitive information.

**Risk**: Information disclosure that could aid attackers.

**Recommendation**: 
- Implement consistent error handling across all functions
- Return generic error messages to clients
- Log detailed errors server-side only

### 8. Temporary File Management

**Vulnerability**: Temporary files are created in the `/tmp` directory with predictable names based on UUIDs.

**Risk**: In a multi-tenant Lambda environment, this could potentially lead to information disclosure.

**Recommendation**: 
- Use more secure random file names
- Ensure files are properly cleaned up after processing
- Consider encrypting sensitive files while at rest in the `/tmp` directory

### 9. Missing Content Security Policy

**Vulnerability**: No Content Security Policy (CSP) headers are set in API responses.

**Risk**: Increased vulnerability to XSS attacks if the API responses are rendered in a browser.

**Recommendation**: 
- Add appropriate security headers to API responses
- Implement a Content Security Policy

## Low Severity Issues

### 10. S3 Bucket Lifecycle Configuration

**Vulnerability**: Files are only deleted after 7 days.

**Risk**: Sensitive user files remain available longer than necessary.

**Recommendation**: 
- Consider reducing the retention period for sensitive files
- Implement different retention policies based on file types

### 11. Logging Improvements

**Vulnerability**: Inconsistent logging practices across functions.

**Risk**: Difficulty in detecting and responding to security incidents.

**Recommendation**: 
- Implement structured logging
- Ensure sensitive information is not logged
- Consider integrating with a log management service

## Implementation Plan

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Remove hardcoded credentials
   - Restrict CORS configuration
   - Implement basic authentication

2. **Short-term Improvements**:
   - Enhance input validation
   - Fix command injection vulnerabilities
   - Migrate job storage to DynamoDB

3. **Long-term Security Enhancements**:
   - Implement comprehensive logging
   - Add file scanning capabilities
   - Develop a proper user management system

## Conclusion

The Serverless Converter application has several security vulnerabilities that should be addressed before deployment to production. By implementing the recommendations in this report, the security posture of the application will be significantly improved.
